# MongoDB Migration Plan

## Overview
Migration from localStorage to MongoDB for subscription data storage.

## Prerequisites
- [x] MongoDB installed locally
- [ ] MongoDB connection tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
- [ ] Create MongoDB connection helper
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Test database connection

### 2. Database Schema
- [ ] Create Subscription model
- [ ] Set up indexes
- [ ] Add validation rules

### 3. Storage Provider
- [ ] Create MongoDB storage provider
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations
- [ ] Add error handling

### 4. Migration Utility
- [ ] Create migration status tracking
- [ ] Implement data migration logic
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Create backup mechanism

### 5. Integration
- [ ] Update storage provider factory
- [ ] Add migration check to login flow
- [ ] Test with existing user data

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for MongoDB provider
- [ ] Migration utility tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Manual testing checklist

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Deploy with dual-write period
- [ ] Monitor migration process

## Migration Strategy
1. First migrate development environment
2. Test thoroughly with sample data
3. Create Atlas cluster for production
4. Migrate production data
5. Keep localStorage as backup initially

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep localStorage backup during migration
2. Implement versioning for migrated data
3. Create rollback scripts

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Connection handling
- [ ] CRUD operations
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Data consistency
- [ ] Performance metrics

## Notes
- Document any issues encountered
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor error rates
