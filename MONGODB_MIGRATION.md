## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] MongoDB installed locally
- [x] MongoDB service running
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] MongoDB connection tested

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup ✅
- [x] Create MongoDB connection helper
- [x] Set up environment variables
- [x] Test database connection
- [x] Add debug scripts

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- [x] Create Subscription model
- [x] Set up indexes
- [x] Add validation rules
- [x] Test schema constraints

### 3. Storage Provider ✅
- [x] Create MongoDB storage provider
- [x] Implement CRUD operations
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Add type safety

### 4. Integration ✅
- [x] Update storage provider factory
- [x] Add server-side API routes
- [x] Test integration in Next.js context
- [x] Verify client-server communication

### 5. Error Handling ✅
- [x] Add error boundary for database operations
- [x] Add loading states for database operations
- [x] Improve error messages
- [x] Add retry mechanisms

### 6. Bug Fixes ✅
- [x] Fix storage implementation import in Dashboard
- [x] Fix prop type mismatches in subscription handlers
- [x] Restore two-column layout
- [x] Consolidate storage implementations

### 7. Authentication ✅
- [x] User model with proper indexes
- [x] Bcrypt password hashing
- [x] JWT session handling
- [x] NextAuth.js integration

## Progress Log

### February 9, 2025
- ✅ MongoDB implementation completed
- ✅ Authentication system migrated
- ✅ All data models working
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ UI optimizations:
  - Better loading states
  - Proper error displays
  - Smooth transitions

### February 25, 2025
- ✅ Fixed MongoDB connection URI handling
- ✅ Improved connection robustness in user registration
- ✅ Enhanced subscription API storage
- ✅ Fixed production connection issues
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## Completed Features
1. Subscription storage in MongoDB
2. User authentication with MongoDB
3. Server-side API routes
4. Improved error handling
5. Loading states
6. Type safety
7. Robust URI normalization and connection handling

## Migration Strategy
- Fresh start approach chosen
- No migration utility needed
- Clean implementation

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Set up MongoDB Atlas for production
2. ✅ Configure production environment
3. ✅ Add monitoring and logging

## Production Checklist
- [x] Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
- [x] Configure connection pooling
- [x] Add monitoring and alerts
- [x] Set up backup strategy
- [x] Configure logging

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code cleanup completed
- [x] Test coverage validated
- [x] Set up production monitoring
- [x] Configure analytics

## Recent Improvements

### MongoDB Connection Robustness
We've implemented the following improvements:

1. **URI Normalization**: Added an advanced URI parsing and normalization system that ensures database names are properly formatted regardless of the connection string structure.

2. **Connection Retry Logic**: Enhanced the retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle temporary connection issues gracefully.

3. **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Improved error logging throughout the application for better troubleshooting.

4. **Isolated API Connections**: Ensured each API endpoint has robust, independent connection handling to prevent cascading failures.

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive MongoDB setup guide in `docs/MONGODB_SETUP.md`
- Updated README with connection information
- Improved error messages for better developer experience
