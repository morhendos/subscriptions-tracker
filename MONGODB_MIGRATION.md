# MongoDB Migration Plan

## Overview
Migration from localStorage to MongoDB for subscription data storage.

## Prerequisites
- [x] MongoDB installed locally
- [x] MongoDB service running
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] MongoDB connection tested

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup ✅
- [x] Create MongoDB connection helper
- [x] Set up environment variables
- [x] Test database connection
- [x] Add debug scripts

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- [x] Create Subscription model
- [x] Set up indexes
- [x] Add validation rules
- [x] Test schema constraints

### 3. Storage Provider
- [ ] Create MongoDB storage provider
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Add type safety

### 4. Migration Utility
- [ ] Create migration status tracking
- [ ] Implement data migration logic
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Create backup mechanism

### 5. Integration
- [ ] Update storage provider factory
- [ ] Add migration check to login flow
- [ ] Test with existing user data
- [ ] Add rollback capability

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for MongoDB provider
- [ ] Migration utility tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Manual testing checklist

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Deploy with dual-write period
- [ ] Monitor migration process

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Review and potentially revert TypeScript configuration
  - Current: `"module": "CommonJS", "moduleResolution": "node"`
  - Consider reverting to: `"module": "esnext", "moduleResolution": "bundler"`
  - Test thoroughly in Next.js context after reversion

## Migration Strategy
1. First migrate development environment
2. Test thoroughly with sample data
3. Create Atlas cluster for production
4. Migrate production data
5. Keep localStorage as backup initially

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development
1. Install MongoDB:
```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
```

2. Start MongoDB service:
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community
```

3. Configure environment:
Create `.env.local` with:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/subscriptions
```

4. Test connection:
```bash
npm run test:db
```

### Common Issues
- MongoDB service not running - Check with `brew services list`
- Environment variables not loading - Run `npm run check:env`
- Connection issues - Make sure MongoDB is running on default port

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep localStorage backup during migration
2. Implement versioning for migrated data
3. Create rollback scripts

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Connection handling
- [ ] CRUD operations
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Data consistency
- [ ] Performance metrics

## Notes
- Document any issues encountered
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor error rates

## Progress Log

### February 8, 2025
- ✅ Initial MongoDB setup completed
- ✅ Connection testing working
- ✅ Environment configuration verified
- ✅ Subscription model created and tested
- 📝 TypeScript config modified for testing - to be reviewed post-migration

## Next Steps
1. Create MongoDB storage provider
2. Implement CRUD operations with error handling
3. Test provider with existing subscription logic
