# MongoDB Migration Plan

## Overview
Migration from localStorage to MongoDB for subscription data storage.

## Current Status
✅ Migration completed successfully
✅ All features working in development

## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] MongoDB installed locally
- [x] MongoDB service running
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] MongoDB connection tested

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup ✅

- [x] Set up environment variables
- [x] Test database connection
- [x] Add debug scripts

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- [x] Create Subscription model
- [x] Set up indexes
- [x] Add validation rules
- [x] Test schema constraints

### 3. Storage Provider ✅
- [x] Create MongoDB storage provider
- [x] Implement CRUD operations
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Add type safety

### 4. Integration ✅
- [x] Update storage provider factory
- [x] Add server-side API routes
- [x] Test integration in Next.js context
- [x] Verify client-server communication

### 5. Error Handling ✅
- [x] Add error boundary for database operations
- [x] Add loading states for database operations
- [x] Improve error messages
- [x] Add retry mechanisms

### 6. Bug Fixes ✅
- [x] Fix storage implementation import in Dashboard
- [x] Fix prop type mismatches in subscription handlers
- [x] Restore two-column layout
- [x] Consolidate storage implementations

### 7. Authentication ✅
- [x] User model with proper indexes
- [x] Bcrypt password hashing
- [x] JWT session handling
- [x] NextAuth.js integration

## Progress Log

### February 9, 2025
- ✅ MongoDB implementation completed
- ✅ Authentication system migrated
- ✅ All data models working
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ UI optimizations:
  - Better loading states
  - Proper error displays
  - Smooth transitions

## Completed Features
1. Subscription storage in MongoDB
2. User authentication with MongoDB
3. Server-side API routes
4. Improved error handling
5. Loading states
6. Type safety

## Migration Strategy
- Fresh start approach chosen
- No migration utility needed
- Clean implementation

## Next Steps
1. Set up MongoDB Atlas for production
2. Configure production environment
3. Add monitoring and logging

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Set up backup strategy
- [ ] Configure logging

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code cleanup completed
- [x] Test coverage validated
- [ ] Set up production monitoring
- [ ] Configure analytics
