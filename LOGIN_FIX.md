# Login Problem Fix

This document explains the login issue that was occurring in the local development environment and provides steps to ensure it works properly.

## Issue

After implementing the "Phase 2" database improvements, login functionality in the local development environment stopped working. This was caused by:

1. Timeouts in the MongoDB connection during authentication
2. Missing or improperly loaded environment variables
3. Insufficient error handling during authentication

## Changes Made

We've implemented several fixes to address these issues:

1. **Improved Environment Variables Loading**:
   - Added better error detection and fallback values
   - Added additional logging during initialization
   - Protected against multiple loads of environment variables
   - Added fallback values for MongoDB connection timeouts

2. **Better Timeout Handling in Auth System**:
   - Added extended timeouts for authentication operations
   - Improved error handling and response
   - Added more detailed logging for authentication issues

3. **Enhanced Error Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging during authentication
   - Improved error messages for database connection issues
   - Added specific handling for timeout errors

## Local Testing Steps

To test that authentication is working in your local environment:

1. **Check your .env.local file**:
   Make sure it contains the following values (create the file if it doesn't exist):

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/subscriptions
   MONGODB_DATABASE=subscriptions
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   MONGODB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000
   MONGODB_SERVER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT=15000
   MONGODB_SOCKET_TIMEOUT=60000
   ```

2. **Start MongoDB locally**:
   Make sure your local MongoDB server is running. You can start it with:
   ```
   mongod --dbpath=/path/to/your/data/directory
   ```

3. **Check console logs**:
   - Look for any database connection errors in the console
   - Monitor the environment variable loading logs starting with `[ENV DEBUG]`
   - Check for the authentication logs starting with `[NEXTAUTH]` or `[Auth]`

4. **Clear browser storage**:
   - Clear cookies and local storage for your development site
   - This ensures that old authentication tokens don't interfere with testing

5. **Restart your development server**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## If Login Still Fails

If you're still experiencing issues with login:

1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Look at the server logs for MongoDB connection issues
3. Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible at the URI in your .env.local file
4. Try using a different authentication method if available (e.g. GitHub provider)
5. Create a user directly in the MongoDB database using the MongoDB shell

Example of creating a user directly in MongoDB:

```javascript
use subscriptions
db.users.insertOne({
  email: "test@example.com",
  name: "Test User",
  hashedPassword: "$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy", // "password123"
  roles: [{ id: "1", name: "user" }],
  emailVerified: true,
  failedLoginAttempts: 0,
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```
