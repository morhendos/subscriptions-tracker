# MongoDB Authentication Migration Plan

## Overview
Migration of authentication system from storage provider to MongoDB with improved security.

## Current Issues
- Using storage provider instead of MongoDB for user data
- Insecure password hashing (base64)
- No proper User model
- Auth service not using MongoDB directly
- No proper error handling for auth operations
- No email verification
- No password reset functionality

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Schema
- [ ] Create User model with:
  - Email (unique, indexed)
  - Hashed password (using bcrypt)
  - Name
  - Roles array
  - Email verification status
  - Created/Updated timestamps
  - Password reset token & expiry
- [ ] Set up indexes for:
  - Email (unique)
  - Password reset token
- [ ] Add validation rules
- [ ] Add automated tests for schema

### 2. Security Implementation
- [ ] Add bcrypt for password hashing
- [ ] Implement password validation rules
- [ ] Set up JWT for password reset tokens
- [ ] Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Add auth middleware
- [ ] Set up CSRF protection

### 3. Auth Service Migration
- [ ] Update auth service to use MongoDB
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Add logging for auth operations
- [ ] Implement user CRUD operations
- [ ] Add email verification
- [ ] Add password reset flow
- [ ] Add role-based access control

### 4. API Routes
- [ ] Add signup endpoint
- [ ] Add login endpoint
- [ ] Add password reset endpoints
- [ ] Add email verification endpoints
- [ ] Add user management endpoints
- [ ] Add proper validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting

### 5. Migration Utility
- [ ] Create script to migrate existing users
- [ ] Add password rehashing for old accounts
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Add rollback capability
- [ ] Add migration logging

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for:
  - User model
  - Auth service
  - API routes
  - Migration utility
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add security tests
- [ ] Add load tests

### 7. UI Updates
- [ ] Update login form
- [ ] Add password reset flow
- [ ] Add email verification UI
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add success notifications

## Security Considerations
- Password requirements
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Rate limiting
  - Max 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes
  - Account lockout after 10 failed attempts
- Session management
  - 30-minute session timeout
  - Automatic logout on inactivity
- Password reset tokens
  - 1-hour expiry
  - One-time use only
- Email verification required for sensitive operations

## Migration Strategy
1. Deploy new User model
2. Deploy auth service changes
3. Deploy new API routes
4. Run migration script for existing users
5. Enable new auth system
6. Monitor for any issues
7. Remove old storage-based auth after 2 weeks

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep old storage-based auth as fallback
2. Monitor auth failures
3. Switch back to old system if critical issues
4. Add feature flag for quick switching

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Monitor auth metrics
- [ ] Clean up old auth code
- [ ] Document new auth system
- [ ] Create user management docs
- [ ] Set up auth monitoring
- [ ] Review security practices

## Notes
- Current user count is relatively small, simple migration
- No downtime required for migration
- Will maintain backwards compatibility for 2 weeks
- Planning to add social auth in future

## Timeline
1. Schema & Security (2 days)

3. API Routes & Testing (2 days)
4. Migration Utility (1 day)
5. UI Updates (1 day)
6. Testing & Fixes (2 days)

Total: 10 working days
