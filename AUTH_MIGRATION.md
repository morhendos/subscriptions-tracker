## Overview
Migration of authentication system from storage provider to MongoDB.

## Current Status
âœ… Core migration completed
ðŸ”„ Rate limiting pending

## Implementation Steps

  - Password (hashed)
  - Name
  - Roles array

### 2. Security Implementation ðŸ”„
- [x] Add bcrypt for password hashing
- [x] Simple password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- [ ] Basic rate limiting for auth endpoints

### 3. Auth Service Migration âœ…
- [x] Update auth service to use MongoDB
- [x] Add error handling with proper error codes
- [x] Handle expected scenarios gracefully
- [x] Clean up old implementation

### 4. API Routes âœ…

- [x] Add proper validation
- [x] Improve error messages

### 5. Migration Utility âœ…
- [x] Migration strategy simplified
- [x] Fresh start approach chosen
