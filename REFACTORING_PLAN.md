# MongoDB Integration Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the MongoDB integration in the Subscription Tracker application.

## Goals

- Reduce code duplication
- Improve error handling and reliability
- Enhance testability and maintainability
- Ensure consistent configuration across the application
- Implement proper separation of concerns

## Refactoring Progress

### Phase 1: Configuration Consolidation ✅

- [x] Create a unified configuration system
- [x] Separate URI utilities into a dedicated module
- [x] Update existing files to use the centralized configuration
- [x] Fix environment variable loading issues
- [x] Add utility scripts for testing connections and authentication

### Phase 2: Connection Management ✅

- [x] Refactor the connection management into a proper class
- [x] Implement dependency injection for better testability
- [x] Create a more robust connection pooling strategy
- [x] Add proper connection lifecycle management
- [x] Implement connection event handling

### Phase 3: Error Handling and Monitoring ✅

- [x] Create a unified error handling system
- [x] Implement standardized error responses for API endpoints
- [x] Add operation wrappers with built-in error handling
- [x] Enhance health check endpoint with better diagnostics
- [x] Complete integration of error handling across all endpoints

### Phase 4: Repository Pattern Implementation

- [ ] Implement repository pattern for data access
- [ ] Abstract MongoDB-specific code from business logic
- [ ] Create interfaces for data access layers
- [ ] Implement unit tests for repositories
- [ ] Add transaction support

### Phase 5: API Integration and Cleanup

- [ ] Update all API routes to use the new repository pattern
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling across APIs
- [ ] Add request validation
- [ ] Improve response formatting
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Notes:

Phase 1 focused on centralizing configuration and fixing environment variable loading issues. We:
- Created a centralized configuration in `database-config.ts`
- Separated URI utilities into `mongodb-uri.ts`
- Fixed environment variable loading issues for local development
- Added debugging utilities and test scripts

### Phase 2 Notes:

Phase 2 focused on improving connection management with these key enhancements:
- Created a singleton `MongoConnectionManager` class using OOP principles
- Implemented proper dependency injection for logger and configuration
- Added event-driven architecture for connection lifecycle events
- Enhanced connection pooling with better reuse and cleanup
- Added advanced monitoring and health check capabilities
- Improved error handling with detailed diagnostics
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the connection manager

### Phase 3 Notes:

Phase 3 focused on establishing a robust error handling system:
- Created a unified error handling module in `unified-error-handler.ts`
- Implemented user-friendly error messages that are safe to display
- Added standardized API error response formatting
- Created operation wrappers with built-in error handling in `operations.ts`
- Enhanced health check endpoint to use standardized error handling
- Integrated error handling across all database-related endpoints
- Improved error formatting for consistent client-side handling
- Focused on essential error handling rather than extensive monitoring

### Next Steps:

For Phase 4, we'll focus on:
1. Designing the repository interfaces
2. Implementing concrete repository classes 
3. Writing unit tests for the repositories
4. Gradually migrating existing code to use the repository pattern
