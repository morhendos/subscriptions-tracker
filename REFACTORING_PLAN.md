# MongoDB Integration Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the MongoDB integration in the Subscription Tracker application.

## Goals

- Reduce code duplication
- Improve error handling and reliability
- Enhance testability and maintainability
- Ensure consistent configuration across the application
- Implement proper separation of concerns

## Refactoring Progress

### Phase 1: Configuration Consolidation âœ…

- [x] Create a unified configuration system
- [x] Separate URI utilities into a dedicated module
- [x] Update existing files to use the centralized configuration
- [x] Fix environment variable loading issues
- [x] Add utility scripts for testing connections and authentication

### Phase 2: Connection Management ðŸ”„

- [ ] Refactor the connection management into a proper class
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for better testability
- [ ] Create a more robust connection pooling strategy
- [ ] Add proper connection lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement connection event handling

### Phase 3: Error Handling and Monitoring

- [ ] Create a unified error handling system
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create dashboard for connection health
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors

### Phase 4: Repository Pattern Implementation

- [ ] Implement repository pattern for data access
- [ ] Abstract MongoDB-specific code from business logic
- [ ] Create interfaces for data access layers
- [ ] Implement unit tests for repositories
- [ ] Add transaction support

### Phase 5: API Integration and Cleanup

- [ ] Update all API routes to use the new repository pattern
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling across APIs
- [ ] Add request validation
- [ ] Improve response formatting
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Notes:

Phase 1 focused on centralizing configuration and fixing environment variable loading issues. We:
- Created a centralized configuration in `database-config.ts`
- Separated URI utilities into `mongodb-uri.ts`
- Fixed environment variable loading issues for local development
- Added debugging utilities and test scripts

### Next Steps (Phase 2):

For Phase 2, we need to focus on the connection management aspect:
1. Create a proper connection manager class that follows OOP principles
2. Implement dependency injection to improve testability
3. Ensure proper connection lifecycle management (creation, pooling, cleanup)
4. Improve error handling for connection issues
