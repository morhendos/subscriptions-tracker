# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Problem

Users were unable to log in on production, receiving 401 Unauthorized errors from the credentials endpoint.

## Root Causes

1. **MongoDB Connection Management**: Recent refactoring changed how MongoDB connections are managed, causing authentication operations to fail in certain scenarios.

2. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables were not properly loaded or utilized during the authentication process.

3. **Connection Persistence**: The MongoDB connection was not being maintained long enough to complete the authentication flow.

4. **NextAuth.js Integration**: The integration between NextAuth.js and our MongoDB authentication was not properly handling production scenarios.

## Solution

### 1. Dedicated Authentication Connection Manager

We created a specialized connection manager for authentication operations in `src/lib/db/auth-connection.ts`. This manager:

- Uses improved connection settings optimized for authentication
- Maintains a persistent connection specifically for auth operations
- Handles connection errors gracefully
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Updated Authentication Actions

The server actions in `src/app/auth-actions.ts` were updated to:

- Use the dedicated auth connection manager
- Improve error handling and reporting
- Add better logging for troubleshooting
- Fix user serialization to avoid circular references

### 3. Debugging Tools

We added a new API route at `/api/auth-debug` that provides detailed information about:

- Current authentication state
- MongoDB connection status
- User counts and database health
- Environment configuration

This endpoint is only accessible in development mode by default but can be enabled in production by setting `ALLOW_AUTH_DEBUG=true`.

## Verifying the Fix

1. **In Development**: Run the application locally and verify login works

2. **In Production**: Deploy the changes and verify login works

3. **Debugging**: If issues persist, enable the auth debug endpoint temporarily by setting `ALLOW_AUTH_DEBUG=true` in your environment variables

## Security Considerations

- The auth debug endpoint is disabled in production by default
- User data is sanitized when debug information is returned
- Sensitive environment variables are masked
- MongoDB connection strings are not exposed

## Future Improvements

- Add comprehensive error tracking for authentication issues
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add monitoring for authentication success/failure rates
- Create a more comprehensive user management system
