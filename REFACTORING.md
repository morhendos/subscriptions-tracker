# MongoDB Configuration Refactoring

## Overview

This refactoring focuses on unifying and consolidating the MongoDB configuration settings throughout the application. The goal is to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and ensure consistent configuration across the app.

## Changes

1. **Unified Configuration System**
   - Created a new `database-config.ts` module with a single source of truth for MongoDB settings
   - Properly structured configuration with environment-specific settings (development vs. production)
   - Added comprehensive documentation for each setting

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Moved URI utilities to dedicated `mongodb-uri.ts` module
   - Added new utility functions for formatting errors and checking ObjectIDs
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

3. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Eliminated redundant configuration in `atlas-config.ts` and other files
   - All modules now reference the centralized configuration

4. **Improved Type Safety**
   - Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for configuration objects
   - Better type safety throughout the MongoDB integration code

## Files Changed

- Added `src/config/database-config.ts` - New centralized configuration module
- Added `src/utils/mongodb-uri.ts` - Dedicated URI utilities
- Modified `src/config/database.ts` - Updated to use centralized config
- Modified `src/lib/db/atlas-config.ts` - Updated to use centralized config
- Modified `src/utils/mongodb-utils.ts` - Now re-exports URI utilities
- Modified `src/lib/db/mongodb.ts` - Updated to use centralized config

## Benefits

1. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Single place to modify configuration settings
   - Consistent settings across all MongoDB-related modules

2. **Better Organization**
   - Clear separation between URI utilities, configuration, and connection code
   - Better adherence to Single Responsibility Principle

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Comprehensive comments explaining each configuration option
   - Clear documentation of environment-specific settings

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - Easier to add new configuration options in the future
   - More structured approach to managing environment variables

## Next Steps

This is the first step in a broader MongoDB integration refactoring. Future steps will include:

1. Refactoring the connection management system
2. Improving error handling and monitoring
3. Updating API routes to use the new connection system
