# Environment Variable Loading Fix

This branch contains fixes for environment variable loading issues that were causing connection problems with MongoDB and authentication failures in the local development environment.

## Changes Made

1. **Environment Variable Debug Utility**
   - Added a new module `src/lib/db/env-debug.ts` with diagnostic tools
   - Provides detailed logging about environment variable loading
   - Includes fallback mechanisms for critical variables when not found

2. **MongoDB Connection Improvements**
   - Updated `src/lib/db/mongodb.ts` to actively check for missing environment variables
   - Added fallback connection strings for development mode
   - Enhanced error reporting with more specific information

3. **NextAuth Authentication Enhancements**
   - Updated the NextAuth route handler to ensure environment variables are available
   - Added more detailed request logging for authentication debugging
   - Includes information about MongoDB connection status in auth logs

4. **Test Connection Script Improvements**
   - Enhanced the MongoDB test connection script with better diagnostics
   - Added server information details to help troubleshoot connection issues
   - Checks database and collection access

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Test MongoDB Connection:**
   ```
   npm run test:connection
   ```
   This will show detailed output about the MongoDB connection attempt and environment variables.

2. **Start the Dev Server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   
3. **Check Authentication:**
   - Try to log in with an existing account
   - Check server logs for detailed authentication process information
   - If there are issues, the logs should show exactly where they occur

## Why This Fixes the Issue

The root cause of the problems was that environment variables from `.env.local` were not being correctly loaded by the application in all contexts. This is a common issue with Next.js, particularly when server components and API routes access environment variables differently.

This fix:
1. Actively checks for missing environment variables
2. Attempts to load them manually if they're missing
3. Provides fallbacks for critical values in development mode
4. Adds extensive logging to help troubleshoot any remaining issues

## Debugging Tips

If you still encounter issues:

1. Look for "[ENV DEBUG]" log entries to see environment variable status
2. Check "[NEXTAUTH]" logs for authentication-specific information
3. Check "[MongoDB]" logs for database connection details

## Future Improvements

- Add an environment variable validation step on application startup
- Create a centralized environment configuration module
- Add automated tests for environment loading
