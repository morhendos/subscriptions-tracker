  - [x] Implemented connection pooling with proper sizing
  - [x] Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - [x] Added connection string validation and sanitization
  - [x] Added health check functionality
  - [ ] Set up production cluster
  - [ ] Set up automated backups
  - [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
  - [ ] Set up connection string rotation
  - [ ] Configure MongoDB Atlas metrics and alerts

### 2. Security Improvements
- [ ] API Protection
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting
  - [ ] Set up CORS properly
  - [ ] Add API route validation
  - [ ] Implement request sanitization
  - [ ] Add security headers

- [ ] Database Optimization
  - [ ] Review and optimize indexes
  - [x] Implement connection pooling
  - [ ] Add query optimization
  - [x] Configure read/write concerns

### 6. Deployment Process
- [ ] Deployment Setup
  - [ ] Create deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Set up staging environment
  - [ ] Configure rollback procedures
  - [ ] Add deployment monitoring
- [ ] Documentation
  - [x] Update MongoDB configuration documentation
