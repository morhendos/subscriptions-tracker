# Production Readiness Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps needed to make the subscription tracker production-ready after the MongoDB migration.

## Current Status
- [x] MongoDB migration completed
- [x] Basic functionality working
- [x] Development environment stable
- [x] Security improvements in progress

## Action Plan

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

  - [x] Enhanced connection configuration with environment-specific settings
  - [x] Implemented connection pooling with proper sizing
  - [x] Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - [x] Added connection string validation and sanitization
  - [x] Added health check functionality and endpoint
  - [x] Added monitoring and alerting configuration
  - [x] Added comprehensive backup configuration
  - [x] Created detailed deployment guide
  - [ ] Set up production cluster (pending credentials)
  - [ ] Set up automated backups (pending cluster)
  - [ ] Configure monitoring alerts (pending cluster)
  - [ ] Set up connection string rotation (pending cluster)

### 2. Security Improvements
- [x] API Protection
  - [x] Implemented rate limiting with different tiers:
    - Health endpoints: 120 requests/minute
    - API endpoints: 60 requests/minute
    - Auth endpoints: 30 requests/minute
  - [x] Added secure CORS configuration
  - [x] Added security headers:
    - X-Frame-Options
    - X-Content-Type-Options
    - X-XSS-Protection
    - Referrer-Policy
    - Strict-Transport-Security
  - [ ] Add API route validation
  - [ ] Implement request sanitization
- [ ] Database Security
  - [ ] Configure network access rules
  - [ ] Set up database user roles
  - [ ] Enable audit logging
  - [ ] Configure SSL/TLS

### 3. Monitoring and Error Tracking
- [x] Error Tracking
  - [x] Set up basic error tracking
  - [x] Configure error boundaries
  - [x] Add performance monitoring
  - [x] Set up error alerting
- [x] Logging
  - [x] Implement structured logging
  - [x] Configure log rotation
  - [x] Add request logging
  - [ ] Set up log aggregation (pending cluster)

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Testing Setup
  - [x] Added MongoDB connection tests
  - [x] Added configuration validation tests
  - [x] Added health check tests
  - [x] Added security middleware tests
  - [x] Added rate limiting tests
  - [ ] Add more integration tests
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Add load testing
  - [ ] Implement E2E tests

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Caching
  - [ ] Implement query caching
  - [ ] Add response caching
  - [ ] Configure cache invalidation
  - [ ] Set up Redis (if needed)
- [x] Database Optimization
  - [x] Review and optimize indexes
  - [x] Implement connection pooling
  - [x] Configure read/write concerns
  - [ ] Add query optimization

### 6. Deployment Process
- [ ] Deployment Setup
  - [ ] Create deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Set up staging environment
  - [ ] Configure rollback procedures
  - [ ] Add deployment monitoring
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Update MongoDB configuration documentation
  - [x] Add MongoDB Atlas setup guide
  - [x] Add monitoring documentation
  - [x] Add security configuration guide
  - [ ] Add deployment guides
  - [ ] Create incident response plan
