# Production Readiness Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps needed to make the subscription tracker production-ready after the MongoDB migration.

## Current Status
- [x] MongoDB migration completed
- [x] Basic functionality working
- [x] Development environment stable

## Action Plan

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas Configuration
  - [ ] Set up production cluster
  - [ ] Configure connection pooling
  - [ ] Set up automated backups
  - [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
  - [ ] Implement proper retry mechanisms
  - [ ] Add connection string rotation mechanism

### 2. Security Improvements
- [ ] API Protection
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting
  - [ ] Set up CORS properly
  - [ ] Add API route validation
  - [ ] Implement request sanitization
  - [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Database Security
  - [ ] Configure network access rules
  - [ ] Set up database user roles
  - [ ] Enable audit logging
  - [ ] Configure SSL/TLS

### 3. Monitoring and Error Tracking
- [ ] Error Tracking
  - [ ] Set up Sentry integration
  - [ ] Configure error boundaries
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring
  - [ ] Set up error alerting
- [ ] Logging
  - [ ] Implement structured logging
  - [ ] Set up log aggregation
  - [ ] Configure log retention
  - [ ] Add request logging

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Testing Setup
  - [ ] Add integration tests

  - [ ] Implement test coverage thresholds

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Caching
  - [ ] Implement query caching
  - [ ] Add response caching
  - [ ] Configure cache invalidation
  - [ ] Set up Redis (if needed)
- [ ] Database Optimization
  - [ ] Review and optimize indexes
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling
  - [ ] Add query optimization
  - [ ] Configure read/write concerns

### 6. Deployment Process
- [ ] Deployment Setup
  - [ ] Create deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Set up staging environment
  - [ ] Configure rollback procedures
  - [ ] Add deployment monitoring
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Update API documentation
  - [ ] Add deployment guides
  - [ ] Create incident response plan
  - [ ] Document monitoring procedures

## Priority Order
1. Infrastructure Setup (Critical)
2. Security Improvements (Critical)
3. Monitoring and Error Tracking (High)
4. Testing Infrastructure (High)
5. Performance Optimization (Medium)
6. Deployment Process (Medium)

## Timeline
- Infrastructure & Security: Week 1-2
- Monitoring & Testing: Week 2-3
- Performance & Deployment: Week 3-4

## Progress Tracking
We'll use this document to track progress by checking off completed items. Each major section will be worked on in dedicated feature branches:

- feature/mongodb-atlas-setup
- feature/security-improvements
- feature/monitoring-setup
- feature/testing-infrastructure
- feature/performance-optimization
- feature/deployment-setup

## Notes
- All changes will be reviewed before merging
- Each feature branch will include its own tests
- Documentation will be updated as we progress
- Regular progress updates will be added here
